              <summary>What is included in your free analysis?</summary>
              <div class="faq-body">
                Our free water analysis tests for hardness, iron, pH, chlorine, TDS (total dissolved solids),
                manganese, and sulfur (hydrogen sulfide). If you have an existing filter system, we will also
                check that it is working properly.

              <summary>What else can you test for?</summary>
              <div class="faq-body">
                We offer testing services for just about any contaminant, including pesticides, MTBE, lead,
                mercury, other heavy metals, and chemicals. We can come to your home or business to take the
                sample for you.

              <summary>Are your systems guaranteed?</summary>
              <div class="faq-body">
                Every system includes the manufacturer’s warranty. Warranty periods vary by unit and
                manufacturer (typically one to ten years).

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How often should my system be serviced?</summary>
              <div class="faq-body">
                Service schedules vary by system, but most systems should be checked at least once per year.
                UV lights and reverse osmosis systems especially benefit from annual service.

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What is a backwash/regeneration?</summary>
              <div class="faq-body">
                Many filter tanks and softeners periodically clean themselves (every 2 days to several weeks,
                depending on the system). This is called backwashing or regeneration. It typically runs when
                water isn’t being used (often around midnight or 2am). During the cycle, accumulated sediment
                and “filter load” are flushed out through a drain line leading to a drywell, septic, or sewage
                system. Afterward, the unit is restored to a cleaner state and ready for service again.

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How do I set my clock?</summary>
              <div class="faq-body">
                Units that backwash usually have a clock that determines when the cycle runs. After a power
                loss, reset the clock to the <strong>current time of day</strong>. Instructions are typically on
                the clock face or in your owner’s manual. Set it for the time of day — <strong>not</strong> the
                time the tank should backwash.

              <summary>How do I shock my well?</summary>
              <div class="faq-body">
                For proper well shocking procedures, contact your local Board of Health Department or follow
                published guidance from a trusted extension program.
